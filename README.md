# Python_Data_Structure_Assignment_Solutions
This repository contains a Notebook designed to strengthen the concepts of Python data structures  **Lists, Tuples, and Sets**  which form the foundation for advanced concepts in **Data Analytics** and **Data Science**.

*Project Overview*

The notebook includes carefully structured practice questions with real-world data analysis context.
Each task covers:
- A clear problem statement
- Example of expected output
- A code cell to write and test your own solution

These exercises help develop logical thinking and coding efficiency, both crucial for data cleaning, data wrangling, and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tasks in analytics.

*Key Learning Outcomes*

- Deep understanding of Lists, Tuples, and Sets
- Proficiency in indexing, slicing, and nested structures
- Real-world usage of set operations like union, intersection, and difference
- Confidence in writing clean and efficient Python code
- Strengthened analytical problem-solving mindset

*Why This Project Matters*

- For data analysts, strong command of Python data structures is foundational.
- This project builds the skills needed to:
- Handle large datasets efficiently
- Prepare and clean data before SQL or Excel analysis
- Write optimized Python scripts for analytics tasks
